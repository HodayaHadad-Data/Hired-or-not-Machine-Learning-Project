# Candidate Hiring Classification Project

This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify whether a candidate gets hired based on various features. The dataset contains information on candidates' previous experiences, qualifications, and other relevant attributes. The project follows a structured approach, including data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, and outlier removal), feature engineering, and model training with hyperparameter tuning.

Several models, including AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, were evaluated using cross-validation techniques. The final model was chosen based on its performance on validation data and was then applied to make predictions on a test set. The project's goal was to build an accurate and generalizable model to assist in candidate selection processes.

This project achieved an AUC of 0.98 on the test set, which I completed during a university course.
